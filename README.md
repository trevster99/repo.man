What is Kodi (XBMC?)


Kodi is an open source media player that plays different digital media streams including podcasts, slideshows, and tv/movies.Â  Kodi is available in over 65 different languages and can be added to different platforms such as Windows, Mac OS X, Android, Raspberry Pi, Linux, etc.
Kodi Add-Ons are exactly what they sound like; they are similar to apps you would put on your phone but are created specifically for Kodi to enhance your viewing.Â  These are features and functions that are not stock or standard on Kodi and are written by third-party developers/coders in python.Â  Kodi Add-Ons will include video website streams, playlists, scrapers, and scripts.

Buffering In Kodi – How to Stop it?
What is the cause?
What is the solution?
Buffering will occur to every Kodi streamer in the world.
Members on Forums and the like are always asking “why is my system/box buffering all the time”.
Who is at Fault?
Well you might ask yourself.
Question – Is it the developers?
Answer – No.
1-Streaming – When you stream it comes from a source which then in turn goes to a server and then the server connects to the network so if there is a limitations then your not going to get the best streams.

2-Streaming times – As we all Know in my life time the busiest time for streaming is going to be Saturday afternoon. (Football) but all so times of the day in the week also have an impact on the source you are trying to stream from.
3- Where do you Live – Yes Yes Yes Servers have physical locations and there are some places on this earth (believe me or not) that cannot connect to the source as good as others so therefore could be impaired.
4- Internet conection – self explanatory? no need to go into any great detail hear, the higher the better.
5- Hardware – If streaming through your router then that could very well be the cause as that might not have the strongest WIFI power. The device your trying to stream from might be in the same predicament as the router.
This is not buffering
1 Addons – when you click on an addon it connects to the web site then when you see the “loading” – “working” wheel/bar and it does not connect This is NOT Buffering.
2 Playback – Kodi will time out after 30/60 seconds to tell you that what ever you are trying to stream that IT doesnt work(the stream that is) Simple.
3 Stutter – Could be down to the fact that the machine/box you are using can not handle the stream quality you are trying to view.
4 Settings – well if your a connoisseur  then go a head but you could realy do yourself more damage than good because this will not SOLVE Buffering issues.
SOLUTIONS

1 Services – you could always pay a subscription to a Debrid service which should limit the buffer.
2 Update – Earlier versions of Kodi might not be efficient as the latest so try to have the latest version of kodi.
3 Connection – well wireless or Ethernet, speaks for it self Ethernet is always gonna be the best.

Q. How can I fix buffering on Kodi?
A. There is not one way to fix buffering, but there are a number of mandatory items to check off to ensure that it isn’t your internet connection causing the buffering:
Make sure your Kodi box is hard-wired. Wireless connections get a fraction of the internet speed of the same wired connection.
Make sure you have at least 5mbps internet speed for streaming movies/TV or 10mbps internet speed for live streaming. This isn’t exact, but are general numbers to help you out.
Try a different source. For a live event, a stream can easily become overloaded and will buffer no matter what. For movies and TV, different file hosts have different speeds in different countries. For example, openload may be quick in one area, but clicknupload may be fast in another. Find what host works best for you.
 

Q. Movie X is out in theatres. Where can I stream it on Kodi?
A. Movies aren’t available to stream until approximately 2 weeks before DVD/Blu-Ray release when the disc gets printed and is available in mass production. Just because one movie leaked early, it does not guarantee the release
