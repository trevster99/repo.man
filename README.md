for any of you experiancing buffer issues or freezing issues 

Q. My videos are buffering a lot please help? 

A. Check your Internet speed on your device and on a PC. We recommend a stable Internet speed of 10+ Mbps Download speed, faster the better. The faster Internet connection you have the faster your TV Show, Live Sports and HD Movies will load. If you have under 10Mbps you should consider upgrading your Internet speed. Remember, each Add-ons is separately managed by a Third Party that is not affiliated with http://kodi.tv or https://www.facebook.com/affordableairdrietv/?ref=page_internal Affordable Airdrie Android Boxes in any way! There will be times when these Add-ons do not operate as they should and you may experience down time or slow transfer rates which could cause buffering. When this does happen, we suggest looking for a new source or add-on to correct the problem. "Sometimes it's not your Internet connection that's the problem it can be the file host that is just too busy try another link".
And remember this is a free stream service so expect addons to be up and down from time to time.  This is why its a good idea to learn how to navigate different addons.  Youtube and google have loys of helpful info and we also have started a support group for your questions and answers.     https://www.facebook.com/groups/178331172661290/
