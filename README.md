Just a Quick Side Note Before We Proceed.  Again Thanks For Your Purches And We Hope To See You Again Soon.  Id like to start off on the topic of 3rd party addons.  Kodi Add-Ons are exactly what they sound like; they are similar to apps you would put on your phone but are created specifically for Kodi to enhance your viewing. These are features and functions that are not stock or standard on Kodi and are written by third-party developers/coders in python. PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT AND RESEARCH A LITTLE BIT SO YOU CAN FIX ANY SMALL ISSUES YOU MAY INCOUNTER.   We do have a support page for questions and concerns aswell thankyou.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/178331172661290/?ref=group_cover
